UIKit for Gideros Studio is a plugin for iOS that allows usage of UIView, UIButton, UITextField, UIAlertView, UIWebView, UIScrollView, UILabel, UISwitch, UISlider, UIToolbar.

Events are dispatched to Gideros Studio.

Known issues:

1. Not all methods and properties are implemented.

2. When using a UISlider on a UIScrollView, the UIButtons stop working
